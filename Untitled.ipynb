    "# Billiards: The Skill Game for Alcoholics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Billiards is a centuries-old game designed by rich people who most likely had nothing better to do with their time than hit small rigid balls with a wooden cue.  Coincidentally, rich people with nothing to do in the 15th century also drank a lot of booze.  Over hundreds of years, these two pastimes have slowly merged into a drunken social endeavor where a missed shot is often accompanied by a loud curse and a spilled pitcher.  Needless to say, the research for this project often devolved into three-beer Wednesday nights filled with feeble attempts to analyze the spin transfers between balls, and even feebler attempts to actually win the game.  An in-depth understanding of steady-state physics, as irony would have it, does nothing to steady oneâ€™s own hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Levity aside, billiards is a mathematically complex game that requires a broad yet deep understanding of solid-state mechanics.  Values such as slipping and rolling friction, linear and angular momentum, and collisions must be considered and manipulated in order to attain a competent level of billiards know-how.  The original goal of our project was to simulate a break in pool with realistic ball-ball and ball-wall spin transfers, sliding friction, and rolling friction.  This proved to be a daunting task in practice due to several factors, such as the massive amount of collisions at the instant of a pool break and the unpredictable nature of frictional impulse.  After our readjustments in project direction, we simulated interactions between two balls, realistically calculating sliding and rolling friction, semi-realistically calculating ball-wall collisions, and elastically calculating ball-ball collisions.  \n",

    "# Intro to the Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several physical variables I considered when dealing with spinning and rolling balls:\n",
    "\n",
    "position $\\vec{d} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "linear velocity $\\vec{v}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and angular velocity $\\vec{\\omega}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code, we used a simple ODE solver to update these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as these variables, there are several constants that I accounted for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wall Friction $\\mu_{w}$ Encountered during wall collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling Friction $\\mu_{r}$ Encountered during ball rolling\n",
    "\n",
    "Sliding Friction $\\mu_{sl}$ Encountered during ball sliding\n",
    "\n",
    "Spinning Friction $\\mu_{sp}$ Encountered during ball spinning in the $\\hat{\\omega_{z}}$ direction\n",
    "\n",
    "Radius $R$ of the ball\n",
    "\n",
    "Gravitational Acceleration $g$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sliding Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "When a pool ball is struck, its $\\vec{v}$ often does not correspond to the proper $\\vec{w}$ required for a perfect roll.  This results in a non-zero velocity of the ball at the point of contact on the table, or slide velocity $\\vec{u}$.  $\\vec{u}$ can be calculated by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{u} = \\vec{v} + R\\hat{z} \\times \\vec{\\omega}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector quantity is important because it determines the direction of the sliding frictional force $\\vec{F_{fs}}$ by the relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{F_{fs}} = - \\mu_{sl}mg\\hat{u}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this force, I calculated the changes in $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{\\omega}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\vec{v}} = -\\mu_{sl}g\\hat{u}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\vec{\\omega}} = \\frac{5}{2R} \\mu_{sl}g\\hat{z}\\times\\hat{u}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rolling Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a pool ball begins sliding, $\\vec{u}$ is acted on by $\\vec{F_{fs}}$ and approaches zero. During this time, the ball's trajectory can take any number of parabolic curves depending on the direction and magnitude of $\\vec{\\omega}$.  Once $\\vec{u}$ reaches zero, however, the ball's linear and angular velocities are \"in sync\", and rolling begins.  The rolling friction of the ball $\\vec{F_{fr}}$ is simply in the $-\\hat{v}$ direction.  Therefore, the changes in in $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{\\omega}$ are calculated simply.  I will use energy dissipation considerations. Since $v = R\\omega$ while rolling, the use of vectors will be unnecessary for a moment.  The total energy is the sum of the kinetic energies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot(\\frac{2}{5}mR^{2})\\omega^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ =\\frac{7}{10}mv^{2}$\n",
    "   \n",
    "The energy dissipation can be found by taking the derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{E} = \\frac{7}{5}mv\\dot{v}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assume that the energy dissipation due to rolling friction must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{E} = -\\mu_{r}mgv$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the prior two equations gives us a very simple result:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\vec{v}} = -\\frac{5}{7}\\mu_{r}g\\hat{v}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\vec{\\omega}} = -\\frac{5}{7R}\\mu_{r}g\\hat{\\omega}$\n",
    "\n",
    "These effects continue until the ball rolls to a stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of collision detection methods necessary to our code: ball-wall collisions and ball-ball collisions.  The former is very simple to calculate.  I simply took the $\\vec{d}$ coordinates of the ball in question and checked to see if they were $<R$ away from any of the four walls.  I will explain further in my code portion.  The second kind of collision detection method is similar to the first, but involves the $\\vec{d}$ of both balls. I found the vector from the center of one ball to another\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{r} = \\vec{d_{2}} - \\vec{d_{1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and checked the if the absolute value was less than the radii of the two balls\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\vec{r}| < 2R$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wall Collisions\n",
